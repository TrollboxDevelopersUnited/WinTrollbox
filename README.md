## Installing via my app maker
Go to https://github.com/Miweoroooo192/web-app-maker

Open it

Write in the website text box: ```https://windows93.net/trollbox``` (or you can just put a random website)

Write trollbox in the title text box (you can put whatever you want but you have to put the text)

Also dont forget to specify the folder source (optional, the deafult is the temp folder and can be accessed by writing %temp%)

Oh and there is a obrigatory thing that you must specify the browser you want to use (edge or chromium)

Click on the make it button and boom!

Also close all the success windows expect for the CMD one

And idk what to put more
